# Introduction

This repository was created to present the CO2 Emission Project in the framework of the Data Scientist MLOPS course provided by [DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/en/). Where we completed the following trainning: 

- [Data Scientist](https://datascientest.com/en/data-scientist-course)
- [MLOPs](https://datascientest.com/en/ml-ops-course)

This repository contains the following items:

- The notebooks used on each steps of the project
- An Streamlit presentation used in the defense to present the project
